Agile methods are used, from requirements, through to analysis/design, implementation and testing. Each week one phase in the development lifecycle is carried out.

What functions it has? 
-------------------

1. Open account: Three types of accounts are supported by the system: 
	+ Saver account
	+ Junior account
	+ Current account
Only customer under age 16 may open a Junior account. A customer may open more than one type of account and must credit it with a minimum figure.
 2. Deposit Funds: Funds may be deposited in an account provided that the depositor provides the appropriate account number. When funds are deposited, they are either cleared (the funds have been fully credited, e.g Cash), or un-cleared (transfer of funds is pending, e.g. using Cheque). Cleared funds are immediately credited to the
account.
